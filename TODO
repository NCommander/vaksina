TODO List:
 - RECONSIDER: Split names loading into firstname/last name for
               parts of the world that use given names first
 - CONSIDER: Specific Exception types for given fail modes
 - CONSIDER: how do we represent entered-in-error or not-given
             FHIR codes. Currently disregarded on bundle parsing
             but could be made an option flag for various reasons
             ...               
 - Implement debug logger that explains in depth why card may
   have been rejected
 - UNIT TESTS!!!!!!!!

 - Need more robust downloader tool of VCI key information
   - *must* log failures for MVP, maybe try multiple at once?
   - Validate data we get from endpoint is valid JWT tokens 
     (how?)
 - Draft Flask API in/out
   - REST based API
     - Possible returns
       - Card is valid
       - Card parses, but bad signature (orange check)
       - Person doesn't have completed vaccines (red check)
       - Not supported (grey check)

 - Handle all non-US vaccines, go through CDC list and more
