FHIR Parsing Information

Each item is granted a resource id starting at 0

Resources are types like patients, etc.
Other resources can refer

So immunization record exists in the form of:
 - resource:0 (Patient)
 - resource:1 (Immunization) (points back to patient)
 - resource:2 (Immunization) (points back to patient)
 
 If there were things like PCR tests, they would be in a similar format

 Handle final collection of data:
 
 Need to create Vaccination Record types that convert medical coding to Vaccine object(?)
  - is this the best way to handle it?

 Once Person/Immunization records assiocated with, we need a parser then checks
 immunizations, and determined if they're good to go, plus time from initial shot
 per COVID protocols. This should be implemented as a generic "class" that takes
 Person record in, returns True/False to determine if someone is vaccinated, which
 can be coded independently of the main Vaksina library (duck typing, yay!)
 
 Validation Procedure:
  - validate_person, and take Person
  
  
  For potential kiosk/appliance use, glue Flask frontend that takes QR code representation in, and response back out.
